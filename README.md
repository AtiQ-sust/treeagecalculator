Outcomes

The calculator will display the age of the tree in years in the "Result" field. The age is calculated using the formula: age = (diameter / species growth rate) * 60 where the "species growth rate" is the average growth rate for the selected species in inches per year.

Things to be aware of

The calculator is only an estimate of the age of the tree. Actual age may differ due to various factors such as soil quality, environmental conditions, and tree health.
The calculator is based on average growth rates for different tree species. Individual trees may grow at different rates.
The calculator does not take into account factors such as tree pruning or damage that may affect the diameter of the tree.

Conclusion

The tree age calculator is a useful tool for estimating the age of a tree based on its diameter and species. However, it is only an estimate and should not be used for scientific or legal purposes.
