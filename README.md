Introduction

The tree age calculator is a tool that helps you estimate the age of a tree based on its diameter and species. The calculator uses a formula to calculate the age of the tree based on the average growth rate of the species.

How to use the calculator

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

Enter the diameter of the tree in inches in the "Diameter" field.
Select the species of the tree from the "Tree Species" dropdown menu.
Click the "Calculate Age" button to calculate the age of the tree.

Practical Example

The tree age calculator available at https://sarpo.net/tree-age-calculator/ is a practical example of how the calculator can be used to estimate the age of a tree. To use the calculator, follow the steps outlined in the "How to use the calculator" section of the Readme guideline.

Enter the diameter of the tree in inches in the "Diameter" field and select the species of the tree from the "Tree Species" dropdown menu. Then, click the "Calculate Age" button to calculate the age of the tree. The calculator will display the age of the tree in years in the "Result" field.

Keep in mind that the calculator is only an estimate of the age of the tree and may not be accurate due to a variety of factors. It is intended for general information purposes only and should not be used for scientific or legal purposes.

Possible outcomes

The calculator will display the age of the tree in years in the "Result" field. The age is calculated based on the formula:
age = (diameter / species growth rate) * 60

Where the "species growth rate" is the average growth rate for the selected species in inches per year. The growth rates for each species are listed in the dropdown menu.

Things to be aware of

The calculator is only an estimate of the age of the tree. The actual age of the tree may be different due to a variety of factors, such as soil quality, environmental conditions, and tree health.

The calculator is based on the average growth rates of different tree species. Individual trees may grow at different rates than the average for their species.

The calculator does not take into account factors such as tree pruning or damage that may affect the diameter of the tree.

Conclusion

The tree age calculator is a useful tool for estimating the age of a tree based on its diameter and species. However, it is only an estimate and should not be used for scientific or legal purposes.
